when a sender send the message it is first received by the server then it is the duty of the server to send the message to all the receivers

note to send the event we send socket.emit  and to receive the event we write socket.on


what is express views ejs

whener you have to build front we can directly make through ejs

only issue is that it is server side rendered frontend 
.emit does not necessary needs a callback
.on needs a call back


power of sockets in real time without refreshing anything we were able to send message from one pesron to another person

used case of sockets
